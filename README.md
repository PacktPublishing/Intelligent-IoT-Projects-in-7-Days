# Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 Days
This is the code repository for [Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 Days](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/intelligent-iot-projects-7-days?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286429), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Intelligent IoT Projects in 7 days is about creating smart IoT projects in just 7 days. This book will help you to overcome the challenge of analyzing data from physical devices.

This book aims to help you put together some of the most exciting IoT projects in a short span of time. You'll be able to use these in achieving or automating everyday tasks—one project per day.

We will start with a simple smart gardening system and move on to a smart parking system, and then we will make our own vending machine, a smart digital advertising dashboard, a smart speaker machine, an autonomous fire fighter robot, and finally look at a multi-robot cooperation using swarm intelligence

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
void loop() {
  int val;
  val = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print("Soil moisture: ");
  Serial.print(val);
  delay(3000);
}
```

In order to work with Drupal 8 and to run the code examples found in this book, the
following software will be required.
Web server software stack:

* Web server: Apache (recommended), Nginx, or Microsoft IIS
* Database: MySQL 5.5 or MariaDB 5.5.20 or higher
* PHP: PHP 5.5.9 or higher

Chapter 1, A Simple Smart Gardening System, details all of these requirements and includes a
recipe highlighting an out of the box development server setup.
You will also need a text editor, following is a suggestion of popular editors and IDEs:
Atom.io editor, https://atom.io/PHPStorm (specific Drupal integration), https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/Vim with Drupal configuration, https://www.drupal.org/project/vimrc Your operating system’s default text editor or command line file editors
